============================

Student project Autumn 2014 - [ETH Zurich](www.ethz.ch/en)

Document classifiers implemented :

- Naive Bayes
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machines

##Miscellaneous

Optimizations :
- Stemming using a cache system to increase performance and space consumption
- Only take the n term with the highter document frequency to minimize memory use
- Remove stop words from document before stemming to eliminate meaningless terms
